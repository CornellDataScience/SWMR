[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . -ed . ] when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . rating : * [lowest rating] |------------------------------| \\\\ * * * * * perfection \\\\ \\\\ * * * * good , memorable film \\\\ \\\\ * * * average , hits and misses \\\\ \\\\ * * sub-par on many levels \\\\ \\\\ * unquestionably awful \\\\ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13\",\n",

       "       \"claire denis ( i can't sleep/nenette and boni/no fear , no die ) has created a cinematic work of great poetry and reverie : a masterpiece . there are many films that influenced denis , but the works of alain renais , especially his muriel , probably influenced her the most . it's a film so visually stunning and so magnificently palpable in its cinematography and in its lively camera movements and fascinating narrative speculations , and most of all , in its lyrical sensuality , that it runs poetically adrift with its listless hypnotic pace , its sparse dialogue forcing the viewer to see what is not being said , and by its strange brooding mood it sets , as it tells in a matter of fact tone a story of hate , alienation and envy through the eyes of the narrow-minded french foreign legionnaire who found freedom in his remorse . its background shots are just as important as its story line and its theme , as it helps explore the everyday boredom the men face , of the trite routines the macho men are under , and the underlying violence it evokes in them . the minimally told story is made all the more powerful by many vivid shots , such as the one of the emerald water contrasted with the barren desert , or of the distant mountains which seem to have a language of their own that speaks to us of things we cannot know , or of the unobtrusive native women in their colorful dresses that we see in the marketplace or at the disco , who strike a chord in us with their musical gestures and mocking tones . the local women are just as much a part of the story as anything else in the film is , even though they are not directly part of the plot . there are also the close-ups of the interracial legionnaires living as brothers who have to reinforce this by ritualistically hugging and separating from each other in what seems to be weirdly homoerotic embraces , but can also be viewed as a parody of such romantic notions . beau travail literally means beautiful work , and this film delivers all that and more . it seems like it has been ages since i have been so enthused about a film as i am by this one . i have a lot of time ahead of me . ' galoup is not afraid to openly state how he was driven by the twisted state of his mind to behave in such a maddening way against such a selfless and blank individual , someone he found hard to believe really exists . time seems irrelevant for the soldiers , memories seem to come and go , as they do their military drills looking at times like teutonic mythical gods while half-naked ( these scenes provoke , mock and remind us of the leni riefenstahl kitsch art and homoerotic heroes she gave us in both triumph of the will and olympiad--though denis's characterizations seemed all the more potent , purposeful and vital ) . to iron a perfect crease in their uniform is part of their reason for being in the legion , because it makes them look special . beau travail is the memories of such idol pleasures and such a need to fit in somewhere , even if it is into something that appears as useless as the legion , which doesn't seem to have any purpose anymore without the days of french colonization and the algerian war . the legion is their love fantasy , it is something that can't be understood by anyone but true lovers . this is her breakthrough genius film , a film that stands heads and shoulders over the talented director's other films . what adds to the film , is the robust musical score of benjamin britten's billy budd oratorio and the choreography staged by one of the actors who played a legionnaire , bernardo montet . all the military exercises were like watching a ballet , as the entire film had the fresh look of something so beautiful , that it has to be seen .\",\n",
